    "A lucky number is a number of a sequence generated by a sieve algorithm: if a number in the positive integers series survives to the sieve filtering algorithm, it's lucky and survives, otherwise it disappears from the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you must obtain a list of numbers, from 1 to the needed size.\n",
    "First number is 1 and it survives: next to him there is number 2, that becomes the sieve's filter: every second number in the list (counting from 1) has to be filtered (as to say every even number).\n",
    "After this step, the next number to survive after 1 is 3: eliminate every third number in the list (counting from 1).\n",
    "After this step, the next number to survive after 3 is 7: eliminate every seventh number in the list.\n",
    "Repeat the steps incrementing the filter condition at every step (as to say that the sieve filter of a new step is equal to the first number greater than the previous step last lucky number) until there are no numbers to eliminate in the list.\n",
