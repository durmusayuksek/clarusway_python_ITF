If the first cell is locked, you cannot free anyone. Each time you free a prisoner, the locked cells become unlocked, and the unlocked cells become locked again.\n",

    "You must free a prisoner in order for the locks to switch. So in the second example where the input is [1, 1, 1] after you release the first prisoner, the locks change to [0, 0, 0]. Since all cells are locked, you can release no more prisoners.\n",
